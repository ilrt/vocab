<p><strong>Creative Commons licences</strong></p>
<p>A means of managing the terms which are automatically attached to copyrighted works, including research data. The suite of licences offered by the Creative Commons organisation enables and encourages the re-use, sharing and distribution of works.

<p><strong>Research data</strong></p>
<p>Data, or units of information which are created in the course of funded or unfunded research, and often arranged or formatted in a such a way as to make them suitable for communication, interpretation, and processing, perhaps by a computer. Examples of research data may include a spreadsheet of statistics, a series of email messages, a sound recording of an interview, a rock specimen or a collection of digital images. Research data does not include data generated in the course of personal activities, desktop or mailbox backups, or data produced by non-research activities such as University administration and teaching.</p>
<p>In other words: Research data is digital information created in the course of research but which isn't a published research output (see below). Research data excludes purely administrative records. The highest priority research data is that which underpins a research output.</p>
<p><strong>Research information</strong></p>
<p>Administrative information relating to the research process. Examples include staff profiles and financial information.</p>
<p><strong>Research output</strong></p>
<p>According to the RAE 2008, assessable research output contains an element of innovation, contributes to scholarship, is publicly accessible and is generalisable. Research output is not limited to texts.</p>
